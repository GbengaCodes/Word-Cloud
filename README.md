# Word-Cloud
This is a script that creates a "word cloud" from a text.  This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

# For the input text of your script, you will need to provide a file that contains text only.
